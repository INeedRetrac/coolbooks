    <p>This injector was built for CS:GO with speed and stealth in mind. Simple interface, clean injection, and regular updates.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="safety">
    <h2>Is It Safe?</h2>
    <p>Yes. The injector uses manual map injection, doesn't touch VAC-protected modules directly, and is built with clean C++ code. As always, use at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Will this get me banned?</strong><br>A: No injector is 100% safe. Ours is undetected at the moment, but using cheats always carries a risk.</p>
    <p><strong>Q: How do I use it?</strong><br>A: Run the Loader.exe as admin, rename your cheat dll to csgo.dll and if your cheat has a steam module change it to steam.dll and then run steam and csgo wait 25 sec after csgo has been launched and then your dll will be injected, keep the dll's in the same folder as the loader.exe</p>
